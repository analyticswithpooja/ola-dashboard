The Ola Data Analytics Project focuses on analyzing large volumes of ride data from Ola, one of Indiaâ€™s leading ride-sharing platforms. This project aims to discover hidden patterns, improve operational efficiency, and gain business insights by using data analytics tools like Excel, Power BI, and MySQL.

We cleaned and structured the data, performed analysis on key aspects such as vehicle types, revenue trends, cancellations, ratings, and overall ride performance. The findings help in understanding customer behavior, identifying areas of improvement, and supporting strategic decisions for better service.
